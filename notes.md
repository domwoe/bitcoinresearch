* Tipping point: 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) stored on blockchain technology

* By 2025: 58% of respondents expected this tipping point to have occurred

* Positive impacts
  * Increased financial inclusion in emerging markets, as financial services on the blockchain gain critical mass
  * Disintermediation of financial institutions, as new services and value exchanges are created directly on the blockchain
  * An explosion in tradable assets, as all kinds of value exchange can be hosted on the blockchain
  * Better property records in emerging markets, and the ability to make everything a tradable asset
  * Contracts and legal services increasingly tied to code linked to the blockchain, to be used as unbreakable escrow or programmatically designed smart contracts
  * Increased transparency, as the blockchain is essentially a global ledger storing all transactions
